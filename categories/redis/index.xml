      <description>My friend, Dustin, has been doing to really cool stuff with RedisTimeSeries. He realized the new RedisTimeSeries features weren&amp;rsquo;t implemented in the client library he was using. I took a look at the library, and decided to create a PR. The issue had already been opened, so I went to work. Forked the repository, kept notes, asked for feedback. It was fun.
