      <description>The work    In my homelab, I&amp;rsquo;m setting up RedisTimeSeries on a Raspberry Pi. I wanted to use Telegraf to deliver metrics from the Raspberry Pi to RedisTimeSeries. There was a function fork that had already submitted a PR.
The PR was started in 2019! It recently had some additional feedback added to it, so I decided to implement some of the feedback.
By creating a fork of the fork and creating a PR for the PR!</description>
