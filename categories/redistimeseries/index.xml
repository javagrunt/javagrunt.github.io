      <description>The work    In my homelab, I&amp;rsquo;m setting up RedisTimeSeries on a Raspberry Pi. I wanted to use Telegraf to deliver metrics from the Raspberry Pi to RedisTimeSeries. There was a function fork that had already submitted a PR.
The PR was started in 2019! It recently had some additional feedback added to it, so I decided to implement some of the feedback.
By creating a fork of the fork and creating a PR for the PR!</description>

      <description>My friend, Dustin, has been doing to really cool stuff with RedisTimeSeries. He realized the new RedisTimeSeries features weren&amp;rsquo;t implemented in the client library he was using. I took a look at the library, and decided to create a PR. The issue had already been opened, so I went to work. Forked the repository, kept notes, asked for feedback. It was fun.
