      <description>I have been having a blast streaming lately. I&amp;rsquo;m streaming more and having even more fun. I hope to encourage others to stream more &amp;ldquo;live-coding&amp;rdquo; or Java/Spring centric content also.
I created this project during a stream and explored the API a little in the process.
Right now, its just capturing two metrics. It&amp;rsquo;s two metrics that can be collected without a &amp;ldquo;user&amp;rdquo; token. It then exposes those metrics to be consumed by Prometheus.</description>

      <description>The work    In my homelab, I&amp;rsquo;m setting up RedisTimeSeries on a Raspberry Pi. I wanted to use Telegraf to deliver metrics from the Raspberry Pi to RedisTimeSeries. There was a function fork that had already submitted a PR.
The PR was started in 2019! It recently had some additional feedback added to it, so I decided to implement some of the feedback.
By creating a fork of the fork and creating a PR for the PR!</description>

      <description>Upgrade a single page site to use Hugo    One of my good friends, Charlie, is living his dream of being an actor in Hollywood. We are both enjoying our career journeys. Charlie&amp;rsquo;s career is about to skyrocket. I spoke to Charlie earlier in the day, and had him look at Hugo themes. I also invited Josh to join in and do the same. The plan was to upgrade both of their websites from single page to using Hugo.</description>

      <description>Using Terraform to Deploy to Terraform Cloud    In a previous life, I used CredHub in my home, to keep all of my credentials and secrets safe. I want to do as much in Terraform as possible. This was me just practicing using Terraform to create/destroy workspaces.

      <description>My friend, Dustin, has been doing to really cool stuff with RedisTimeSeries. He realized the new RedisTimeSeries features weren&amp;rsquo;t implemented in the client library he was using. I took a look at the library, and decided to create a PR. The issue had already been opened, so I went to work. Forked the repository, kept notes, asked for feedback. It was fun.
